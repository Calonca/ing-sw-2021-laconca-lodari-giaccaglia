## Project specification
The project consists of a Java version of the board game *Maestri del Rinascimento*, made by Cranio Creations.

You can find the full game [here](http://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/masters-of-renaissance/) and the rules [here](https://github.com/Calonca/ing-sw-2021-laconca-lodari-giaccaglia/blob/master/maestri-rules-en.pdf).

The final version includes:
* initial UML diagram;
* final UML diagram, generated from the code by automated tools;
* working game implementation, which has to be rules compliant;
* source code of the implementation;
* source code of unit tests.

## Usage

### Windows/Linux/MacOS 

1. Open the command line
2. Clone the repository
3. In the repository's directory, run:
```bash
java -jar Maestri.jar [mode] [port] [ip] [nickname]
```

Modes:
  
| Shortcut | Name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| ` -c` | `-cli`   |Starts the CLI and connects to server with port|
| `-g` | `-gui`|Starts the GUI and connects to server with port|
| `-s` | `--server`|Starts server with port|

Mode argument can be run without further arguments(TCP port & nickname). In such case or in case of mssing arguments these will be asked later.

* We implemented a 3D gui based on a simplified model of the server's state machine. The user can freely see their board, using W and S to cycle between Board view, Market view, and Frontal view, which covers every game component. While looking from the Frontal view, the player can use D and S keys to rotate around the table, with 90 degree steps. Both the CLI and GUI implement real time updates on the game state. Common elements, such as CardShop and ResourceMarket are shared between all players, each players sees them in front of their board but they are actually synchronized

## Testing
* All unit test have been automated when possible. For some network functionalities it has been necessary to perform some manual QA instead
  of a mock test , for which it would have required too many stubs (being a stateful protocol) so we choose
  manual Quality Assurance.

* All the model classes have been extensively covered, along with most of the controller's classes when possible. Some functionalities regarding
  production output conversion and leader activation do not have an automated test, but our manual tests led us to assert that the functionalities
  implemented are stable in all cases.

* Clicking repeatedly during the drag and drop action may cause issues.

* All the unit test have been run before each commit
